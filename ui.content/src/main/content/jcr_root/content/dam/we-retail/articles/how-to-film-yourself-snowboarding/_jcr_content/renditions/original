<p>POV video cameras have flooded our slopes for better or for worse. The little devices are like digital antennae, capturing everything from first turns to epic bails. (Google ?skier cliff fall fail.? That one?s a winner.) Unfortunately, a lot of this action turns out with crooked frames, shaky shots, and poor edits. To make the most of your megabytes, consider these tips.</p>
<p><b>Know Your Camera</b><br>
These gadgets and their unmarked buttons can be tricky. Auto settings are great, but many cameras have adjustable settings, like white balance, exposure, frame rate, etc., that you can dial in on your computer. Play around with these for a different look. Make sure you know what function does what and that the recording has actually started before you drop in.</p>
<p><b>Get That Angle</b><br>
Strap that almost-indestructible camera in strange places and get weird with it. Suction cup it to the top of your board, mount it to your boot, film backward?there are plenty options and mounts that are yet to be explored. Just make sure your mount it as sturdy as possible and use a back up leash.</p>
<p><b>Create Your Own</b><br>
Don?t see the mount you?re looking for? Make one. Use a broomstick, dowel, bendable copper tubing, or buy an extendable monopod ($10?$30) and mount your camera to it. Go to any bustling resort and you?re bound to see some newfangled camera-holding contraption. Find your inspiration in the liftline.</p>
<p><b>Mix It Up</b><br>
Face it, no one wants to watch your unedited top-to-bottom POV pow runs unless you?re Sammy Luebke or Xavier De Le Rue. Edit in other angles, follow cams, and static shots with the supplied software or drop in on a legit program like Final Cut. Who knows, you might even land a job as a filmer.</p>
<p><b>Just The Tip</b><br>
See it before you send it with the Bluetooth Chip ($30) or LCD BacPac ($80) add-ons for Contour and GoPro cameras.</p>
